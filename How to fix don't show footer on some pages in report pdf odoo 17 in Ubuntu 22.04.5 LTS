If you installed WKHTMLTOPDF via the APT Repository in Ubuntu 22.04 then you will have 0.12.6, but not the correct patched version.
You will need to install the patched version.

#update server and make sure wget is installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget

#download the patched version of wkhtmltopdf
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-2/wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb

#install, which will likely error out
sudo dpkg -i wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb
#run the below to fix errors
sudo apt-get install -f
#re-run dpkg to finish the install
sudo dpkg -i wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb
